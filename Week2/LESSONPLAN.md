# Lesson Plan JavaScript3 Week 2

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student:

- How to use the `fetch` API to do AJAX calls
- The structure and use of `Promises`
- The `this` keyword and its relationship with `scope`

## Core concepts

FIRST HALF (12.00 - 13.30)

1. The structure and use of `Promises`

Notes:

- It's the accepted solution to [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/)
- It's a way to introduce asynchronicity to your application
- Makes asynchronous code read like it's synchronous

**Show examples**

2. How to use the `fetch` API to do AJAX calls

Notes:

- Modern replacement of XMLHttpRequest
- Uses Promise structure
- The Fetch API is defined in the browser
- Only modern browsers support it (show [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch))
