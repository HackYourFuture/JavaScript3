# Reading material for the second lecture:

```
In week two we will discuss the following topics:
• Async vs Sync
• Event Loop (order of execution)
• Promises
```

Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the second lecture:

## Async vs Sync

Watch this YouTube video (24 mins) from Traversy Media, introducing **promises** and **async/await**. In this week's lecture and homework we will focus on promises as an elegant replacement for callbacks. Next week we will cover async/await, which provides an alternative syntax for 'consuming' promises.
