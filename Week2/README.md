# Reading material for the second lecture:

```
In week two we will discuss the following topics:
• Async vs Sync
• Event Loop (order of execution)
• Promises
```

Here are resources that we like you to read as a preparation for the second lecture:

### Async VS Sync

- [Stacks/Queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjI1WNcIntg) (5 mins)
- Read about Asynchronous vs. Synchronous programming: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/synchronous-asynchronous-javascript/
- [Why closures are helpful with async code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13343340/calling-an-asynchronous-function-within-a-for-loop-in-javascript)

### Fundamentals

- [Event Loop](../../../../fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/event_loop.md)
