# Homework Week 2

```
Topics discussed this week:
• Async vs Sync
• Event Loop (order of execution)
• Promises
```

## Step 1: Read

- Read this article on scopes & closures: [explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures](https://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/)

- If you are still not completely clear on promises, here are some additional resources :ring:

    - [Google's post about Promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises)
    - [A nice article from David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/promises)
    - [A real life example](https://github.com/mdn/js-examples/blob/master/promises-test/index.html)
    - [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13343340/calling-an-asynchronous-function-within-a-for-loop-in-javascript)
    - YouTube: [promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBupia9oidU)


## Step 2: Feedback

- Create at least 2 issues (bug / feature / code improvement) on another student's GitHub repository.
- Solve the issue(s) proposed by another students in your GitHub repository. More info [here](https://hackyourfuture.slack.com/files/michahell/F31BX1XT6/Merging_a_local_branch_into_master).

## Step 3: Promises

_Deadline Saturday_

The assignment for this week is:

- Complete your GitHub app code from the previous week, if needed, to meet the requirements from that week's assignment.
- Replace all asynchronous callbacks (e.g. as used with XMLHttpRequest) by ES6 promises.
- Beautify your app's styling.

Bonus assignments:

- Make your app responsive (using media queries)
- Make your app ARIA-compliant

Note:

1. Please remove all redundant, commented-out code and console.log's from your files before pushing your homework as finished. There is no need for your mentors to review this stuff.
2. Please make sure your code is well-formatted and follows the recommended naming conventions.

## Step 4: Read before next lecture

Go through the reading material in the [README.md](../Week3/README.md) to prepare for your next class.
