# Lesson Plan JavaScript3 Week 3

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student:

- The purpose and use of `async/await`
- What is `Object-Oriented Programming` (OOP) is and how it's applied to JavaScript
- How to use ES6 `classes`

## Core concepts

1. The purpose and use of `async/await`

Notes:

- It's an upgrade to `Promises`
- Makes writing an asynchronous function more readable

2. What is `Object-Oriented Programming` (OOP) is and how it's applied to JavaScript

Notes:

- It's a programming style; it defines how to organise your application
- In OOP each program would be split up into self-contained objects, that then communicate with each other
- Each object represents a part of the application: it contains its own data and logic
- OOP is meant to make thinking about your applications easier, by having each object represent a real-life entity (i.e. Users, Profiles, Products)

3. How to use ES6 `classes`

Notes:

- `classes` are a modern way of creating objects in JavaScript
- It's `syntactical sugar` for object constructors
- A `class` is a blueprint of an object, that can be instantiated
