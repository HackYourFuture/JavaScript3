# Lesson Plan JavaScript3 Week 3

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student:

- The purpose and use of `async/await`
- What is `Object-Oriented Programming` (OOP) is and how it's applied to JavaScript
- How to use ES6 `classes`

## Core concepts
FIRST HALF (12.00 - 13.30)
## 1. async/await

### Explanation
- It's an upgrade to `Promises`
- Makes writing an asynchronous function more readable
### Example
### Excercise
### Essence


## 2. What is `Object-Oriented Programming` (OOP) is and how it's applied to JavaScript

### Explanation
- It's a programming style; it defines how to organise your application
- In OOP each program would be split up into self-contained objects, that then communicate with each other
- Each object represents a part of the application: it contains its own data and logic
- OOP is meant to make thinking about your applications easier, by having each object represent a real-life entity (i.e. Users, Profiles, Products)

SECOND HALF (14.00 - 16.00)

## 3. How to use ES6 `classes`

### Explanation
- `classes` are a modern way of creating objects in JavaScript
- It's `syntactical sugar` for object constructors
- A `class` is a blueprint of an object, that can be instantiated
